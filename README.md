# Robotics Specialization 
This repository cosists of my project works towards "Robotics Specialization" offered by Penn through COURSERA. This specialization is a bundle of six courses, and to get a specialization certificate we need complete all courses. So far i have completed 2 courses of this specialization.

### About Specialization (Created by:  University of Pennsylvania) 
The Introduction to Robotics Specialization introduces you to the concepts of robot flight and movement, how robots perceive their environment, and how they adjust their movements to avoid obstacles, navigate difficult terrains and accomplish complex tasks such as construction and disaster recovery. You will be exposed to real world examples of how robots have been applied in disaster situations, how they have made advances in human health care and what their future capabilities will be. The courses build towards a capstone in which you will learn how to program a robot to perform a variety of movements such as flying and grasping objects.
